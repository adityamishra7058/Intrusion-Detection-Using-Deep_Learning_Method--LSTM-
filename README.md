# Intrusion-Detection-Using-Deep_Learning_Method--LSTM
Tried to implement Research Paper "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning Method for Intrusion Detection in  Network Security" and improved it by referring another research paper.

## This project is divided into 2 components, that are Multiclass Classification and Binary Classification.
## Research Paper Implemented:
